# reTax
Do you want to calculate Taxes with different percentages? No problem!

# Usage

Use your mobile as a VAT calculator.

It is a tedious procedure to recalculate VAT for places with
different rates. For this reason (since I need it) I created
a simple J2ME application which automatically computes between
two VAT rates, while you type.

The two rates are completely user specified and also the value
without tax is displayed. The next time you'll also reopen this
application, the tac values will have been saved!


# Compile

The program is distributed already in binary (jar & jad) mode, ready
to be installed in any mobile device with new java implementation.

If you want to compile it, you will need at least WTK2.1. A preliminary
makefile is provided, but I don't know if this will work for you
(it works for me).
